## Startup Specification Assignment

#### Elevator Pitch

Often times when I go on vacation and stay at a vacation rental like Airbnb or Vrbo with my family, we end up having to stop at some grocery store nearby in order to stock up on the food we need for the time period.  This is such a hassle and takes away from the essense of vacation: **relaxation**. I've got an idea for an application that allows for owners of Vacation Rentals to allow their temporary tenants to get the vacation rental stocked with the groceries they need prior to their arrival.  This would be better than a simple delivery service because the desired food would be inside the vacation rental, in the refrigerator or cabinets, upon arrival.  Talk about getting right to vacationing!  

#### Key Features

The application will include the ability for the vacation rental owner to register their vacation rental on the application and their tenants to be able to customize an order to be delivered and stocked in the rental.  The tenant will get updated when the food has been stocked with a photo of what has been stocked.  Tenants can leave a review on the vacation rental stocking experience.

#### Technology Use
    
The app will include *Authentication* because Owners will be able to register their vacation rental on the service, while tenants will be able to create an account and customize their order.  The app will include *Database data* with its storage of vacation rental addresses as well as customer orders.  The app will include *Websocket data* by updating the tenants of the delivery status.
